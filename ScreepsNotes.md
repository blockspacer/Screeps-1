### QA

* [How do I create a new structure in Screeps?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27051872/how-do-i-create-a-new-structure-in-screeps)
  * Get room:
    * By room name: `Game.rooms['W25S17']`
    * By spawn: `Game.spawns['Spawn1'].room`
* [Range of towers attack?](https://steamcommunity.com/app/464350/discussions/0/3182216552778656960/)
  * The towers can attack everything in the room when the towers are. Their efficiency decrease with range to a target.
